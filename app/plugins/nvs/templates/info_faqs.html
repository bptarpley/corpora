        <h2 class="anchor" id="nvs-terms-and-definitions">NVS Terms and Definitions</h2>
        <p><strong>Accidentals:</strong> See Emended Accidentals.</p>
        <p><strong>Act- and Scene-Headings:</strong> A numerical system making possible precise reference to any
          scene in Shakespeare. The New Variorum volumes use the act- and scene-numbering of the Riverside edition
          for the purposes of external reference (NVS Handbook 14).</p>
        <p><strong>Appendix:</strong> Section of the New Variorum that follows the play text, textual notes, and
          commentary notes and includes information about irregular, doubtful, and emended accidentals in the
          volume’s copy-text, unadopted conjectures in the editions collated, authenticity of the text, printer’s
          reliability, early editions, sources, criticism—themes, genre, characters, language and style, etc.--,
          the history of performances, and music (NVS Handbook 2-3, 115).</p>
        <p><strong>Bibliography:</strong> Alphabetical list by author’s last name of all scholarly and critical
          works that are quoted from or referred to anywhere in the edition (NVS Handbook 148).</p>
        <p><strong>Collation:</strong> The process of comparing the copy-text in hand to one or multiple other
          editions line by line, word by word, letter by letter, and point by point in order to reveal differences
          and establish completeness. All fully collated editions listed for each NVS play undergo this process.
          (NVS Handbook 36; “Glossary of book history terms” in Folgerpedia).</p>
        <p><strong>Commentary Notes:</strong> Commentary notes provide, as in previous New Variorum editions, a
          condensed historical survey of significant attempts (including those of the present editor) to
          establish, elucidate, and interpret particular words, phrases, lines, and passages. Like the surveys of
          opinion in the appendices, the commentary should provide a comprehensive, historical perspective. This
          means that much commentary that seems to the editor mistaken will be included along with that which
          seems to him or her correct (mere nonsense of course to be excluded), and that wherever possible, credit
          will be given to the first editor, scholar, or critic to provide each explanation (NVS Handbook 106).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Conjectural Emendation:</strong> Process that involves restoring the original reading of an
          extant text that appears to be corrupt. Unadopted conjectural emendations are excluded from historical
          collation recorded in the notes and listed in the appendix only. Conjectural emendations that have been
          adopted will be “recorded in the historical collation, and credit will there be given to the original
          proposer of the conjecture” (NVS Handbook 3).</p>
        <p><strong>Copy-text:</strong> The first edition of a play against which all other subsequent editions of
          the play are collated--or compared line by line, word by word, letter by letter, and point by point.
          Most of the editions use The Shakespeare First Folio (1623) as the copy-text; however, the First Quarto
          (1608) has also served as the copy-text for certain editions, including King Lear. The general and
          edition editors decide which to use and which missing parts from other texts should be inserted into the
          copy-text from earlier or later editions (NVS Handbook 6).</p>
        <p><strong>Dramatis Personae:</strong> List of characters in each play. The list of characters appears in
          the NVS before the head-title. When the Variorum’s copy-text prints the list after the play-text, as in
          F1, the line numbers will reflect the character list’s position and line number in F1. For example, in
          The Winter’s Tale, Emilia appears on line 3380 in the “The Names of the Actors List,” which is printed
          at the very end of the First Folio volume (NVS Handbook 8-9).</p>
        <p><strong>Emended Accidentals:</strong> Errors in a text’s spelling, punctuation, italicization,
          capitalization, etc. that mainly affect its formal presentation, rather than the meaning of the text
          itself are considered accidental. The New Variorum editions “will leave intact as much as possible of
          the original accidental texture as might have any conceivable significance.” Any emendations of
          accidentals are made silently and recorded in the appendix of emended accidentals, while substantive and
          semi-substantive emendations are recorded in the textual notes (NVS Handbook 9-11).</p>
        <p><strong>First Folio:</strong> A posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare’s dramatic works, published
          in 1623 by Shakespeare’s friends John Heminges and Henry Condell. The First Folio has served as the
          copy-text for most of the NVS editions. A notable exception in King Lear, which takes the 1608 First
          Quarto as its primary copy-text.</p>
        <p><strong>Folio:</strong> The size and shape of a book, as determined by the number of times the original
          sheet of paper or parchment has been folded to form its constituent leaves. Folio (fol. or 2°) = folded
          once (“Glossary of book history terms” in Folgerpedia).</p>
        <p><strong>Headline:</strong> See Running Head</p>
        <p><strong>Index:</strong> Lists names and topics in the New Variorum volume in alphabetical order.</p>
        <p><strong>Lemma:</strong> A version of a line, word, character, or point in the copy-text against which
          all variants are compared in a textual note.</p>
        <p><strong>NVS Fully Collated Editions:</strong> Editions of such primary importance in the history of the
          transmission of the text that they have been compared with the copy-text line by line, word by word,
          letter by letter, and point by point (NVS Handbook 36).</p>
        <p><strong>NVS Selectively or Occasionally Quoted Editions:</strong> Editions of secondary importance
          (often because they derive from a parent edition from whose readings they seldom vary, or because their
          texts are in general not very original or interesting), and readings from them are recorded only
          occasionally when they are of special interest. Each Variorum editor must decide which editions deserve
          full collation and which only occasional quotation (NVS Handbook 36-37).</p>
        <p><strong>Play Text:</strong> The text of a variorum edition play. It includes the copy-text and variants
          from fully and selectively collated witnesses. </p>
        <p><strong>Quarto:</strong> The size and shape of a book, as determined by the number of times the
          original sheet of paper or parchment has been folded to form its constituent leaves. Quarto (4 to or 4°)
          = folded twice (“Glossary of book history terms” in Folgerpedia).</p>
        <p><strong>Recto:</strong> The front of a leaf, the right hand side of an opening of a bound volume. cf.
          verso (“Glossary of book history terms” in Folgerpedia).</p>
        <p><strong>Running Head:</strong> Sometimes also called a headline or running-title, the line of type at
          the top of the page of text which contains the title of a book or section (“Glossary of book history
          terms” in Folgerpedia).</p>
        <p><strong>Semi-substantive variants:</strong> Changes of accidental details, including punctuation,
          spelling, typography, and spacing and/or hyphenation that affect meaning; spelling or punctuation that
          significantly affects meter in verse; spelling that affects rhyme in verse, such as shrew/shrow;
          relining of verse as prose, prose as verse, or verse as different verse; Diacritical marks added by
          editors to indicate the number of pronounced syllables (i.e., marks which affect meter); variants in
          names of characters when there has been editorial disagreement about which character is involved or
          question about identification of an originally unnamed character (NVS Handbook 37-40).</p>
        <p><strong>Sigla:</strong> Abbreviations used for NVS Variorum editions. They are limited to a total of
          five characters. According to the NVS Handbook, “in order to avoid exceeding a total of five characters,
          the basic sigla for most editions have been limited to four characters so as to permit the addition of a
          number distinguishing the original from a later edition (THEO1, THEO2): and the basic sigla for most
          modern editions have been limited to three characters so as to permit the addition of a number
          distinguishing the original from a ‘new’ edition bearing the same name (ARD1, ARD2) and a letter
          distinguishing the original from a revised edition of a particular play within a “new” series (CAM3a,
          CAM3b). Each title is preceded by the siglum that identifies the edition in the textual notes and other
          textual apparatus” (NVS Handbook 142).</p>
        <p><strong>Substantive variants:</strong> All verbal changes that affect meaning---i.e., all changes,
          substitutions, omissions, additions, and re-ordering of words, phrases, lines, or scenes (NVS Handbook
          35).</p>
        <p><strong>Textual Notes:</strong> Notes that inlclude two kinds of information: a record of significant
          emendations (if any) of the copy-text made by the Variorum editor; and a record of the historical
          collation of substantive and semi-substantive variants in major editions other than the copy-text, down
          to the present day (NVS Handbook 28).</p>
        <p><strong>Through Line Numbers (TLN):</strong> New Variorum texts use the Through Line Numbers (TLN) of
          Charlton Hinman&#x27;s First Folio published by Norton Press, that is, numbers straight through the play
          including stage directions rather than line numbers starting afresh at the beginning of scenes. The
          through line numbers are “used for all internal reference to the play within its own edition--that is,
          for all reference to the play in the textual and commentary notes and in the appendices. These Folio
          numberings will be used even when the copy-text is a quarto (NVS Handbook 22).</p>
        <p><strong>Turnunders and Turnovers:</strong> Words at the very end of a line that are printed just above
          or below the line and inherit the number of the line. In the New Variorum editions, “Any note on a
          turnover or turnunder, therefore, will refer to it by the through line number (TLN) of the verse line it
          completes, and not by the number of the typographic line to the right of which it was printed in the
          copy-text” (NVS Handbook 24).</p>
        <p><strong>Variorum Edition:</strong> A typical page of the edition proper will, as before, have three
          sections--text, textual notes (including historical collation), and commentary notes--as well as page
          numbers, the Riverside edition’s act-scene-line cross-reference numbers in the running heads (see ch.
          IV), and Quarto and/or Folio signature and column numbers in the margins of the play text. After text,
          textual notes, and commentary, follows the appendix (which includes irregular, doubtful, and emended
          accidentals in FI, unadopted conjectures in the editions collated, authenticity of the text, printer’s
          reliability, early editions, sources, criticism—themes, genre, characters, language and style, etc.--,
          historical performances, music), bibliography, and index (NVS Handbook 2-3).</p>
        <p><strong>Variorum Edition of Copy-text:</strong> The Variorum Edition is “a modified diplomatic reprint
          of the copy-text which is a literam reprint, according to (or adjusted to) Folio lineation, and with
          minimal editing” (NVS Handbook 5).</p>
        <p><strong>Variant:</strong> A form or version of something that differs in some respect from the lemma in
          the copy text. In an attempt to keep the textual notes manageable and focused on important information,
          there are four different ways of recording data collected in the historical collation of editions: (1)
          only substantive and semi-substantive variants will be recorded in the notes, and variants of accidental
          details that do not affect meaning will be ignored; (2) all substantive and semi-substantive variants
          from fully collated editions will be recorded in the notes; (3) variants in the accessories--stage
          directions, speech prefixes, act-and-scene headings, and place headings--will be listed more selectively
          than variants in the text proper; and (4) only those conjectural readings adopted in one of the texts
          collated will be recorded in the textual notes (NVS Handbook 35).</p>
        <p><strong>Verso:</strong> The back or reverse of a leaf, the left hand side of a bound volume. cf. recto
          (“Glossary of book history terms” in Folgerpedia).</p>
        <p><strong>Witness:</strong> A single material instance of a given text (“Glossary of book history terms”
          in Folgerpedia).</p>
