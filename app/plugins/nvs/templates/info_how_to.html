          <h2>How to Use</h2>
          <p>The Center of Digital Humanities Research, (CoDHR) is now the new home of the New Variorum Shakespeare
            series (NVS), taking the project over from the Modern Language Association (MLA). Texas A&amp;M has now
            made the NVS editions that were only previously published in print freely available online to scholars,
            educators, students, and performers via a fully networked digital platform called Corpora. Visit the NVS
            Info / About page to learn more about the history of the NVS and the scope of this project.</p>
          <p>To navigate this site... will add content about links and different pages, including FAQs and
            videos.</p>
          <p>Information about the Variorum Reader (play text, textual notes, and commentary notes)</p>
          <p>Brief explanation of the appendix, bibliography, and front matter</p>
          <p>Currently, we have two NVS plays available for users: A Midsummer Night’s Dream and The Winter’s Tale.
            We are currently working on making The Merry Wives of Windsor, A Comedy of Errors, Julius Caesar, The
            Tempest, and Richard III available on this site.</p>
          <p>Please visit our Contributors page to find out more about the designers, programmers, editors, and
            board members who made this project possible.</p>
          <p>Below you will find information about how to perform basic and advanced searches.</p>

              <div><p>A simple search will return a wide range of results based on keyword searching. Results are
                obtained by searching for terms or keywords across all fields. For example, if a user performs a
                simple search for the keyword “heretic” by typing the word in the Simple Search box they will get
                1,003 results as the simple search returns all instances of the word in the play text as well as in
                the commentary notes.</p></div>
