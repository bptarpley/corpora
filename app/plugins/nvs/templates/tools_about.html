                  The digital edition of the NVS aims to produce forward-looking scholarly tools for creating, reading,
                  and displaying the complexity and connections of a variorum in a web-based environment. Our interfaces
                  and applications make the most of the affordances of the medium while maximizing the research potential
                  of networked and accessible archival resources. With our July 2021 launch, we introduce to the user
                  the beta version of the Variorum Reader (and its affiliate, the Paratext Reader). On the backend, NVS
                  editors are learning to use CoDHR’s web application, Corpora. In the coming years, we will continue to
                  refine these tools and introduce ones, as outlined below. The design and research team, together with
                  the board and editors, consider these efforts to be integral to the larger research mission of the NVS.

            <h2>The Variorum Reader</h2>
            <p>
                The digital edition of the NVS features a visual and interactive reimagining of the apparatus of the
                variorum (play text, textual notes, and commentary). It associates a given play line to pertinent
                textual notes (referred to as “variants”) by visualizing their presence in the form of a histogram which
                compactly conveys variation over time throughout the editions fully collated by the editors. For any
                line with variants, a “disclosure triangle” appears to the left of the text, allowing the user to expand
                that aggregated view and see exactly how a given collated edition differs from the copy-text.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the text for a given line are also highlights which denote the presence of commentary relevant to the
                highlighted word(s). Clicking on those highlights scrolls the commentary pane to the right such that the
                user can see commentary pertinent to the highlighted text. Throughout the commentary, various play
                lines, collated editions, bibliographic entries, and sections of the appendices are referenced. Those
                references appear as links, and the user is able to click on those links in order to summon further
                information appearing in the form of pop-up modals which can be left open and moved around on the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reader is also afforded the opportunity to search the play text, variants, and commentary using
                three modes of searching. The default “fuzzy” search makes use of Early Modern English synonyms, so that
                the user can use modern spellings for words and still find their equivalents as spelled using earlier
                conventions—i.e. a search for “sleepy drinks” in The Winter’s Tale will show results for “sleepie
                drinkes,” etc. The “exact” search only matches on exact spellings of search terms. The “wildcard”
                search allows you to make use of the asterisk (*) to look for results based on partial matches—i.e. a
                search for “kin*” will show results for “kin,” “king,” “kingdom,” etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Variorum Reader is currently in beta. More work is to be done before the reader will be fully
                accessible to screen readers, will work seamlessly across all browsers (including mobile devices in
                portrait mode), and will be fully vetted in terms of the accuracy of the synthetically produced variants.
                At present, accessing the Variorum Reader on Google Chrome from a laptop or desktop computer provides
                the best experience.

              <h2>The Paratext Reader</h2>
              <p>
                  The digital NVS also features a reader for the paratexts of a given edition, including the Front
                  Matter, Bibliography, and Appendix. The user is offered a table of contents for navigating the various
                  sections of a given paratext, and throughout the text (particularly of the Appendix), references to
                  other material appear as links which, when clicked on, summon pop-up modals containing additional
                  information which can be left open and repositioned.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The Paratext Reader is also in beta. The Appendix in particular features a wealth of information,
                  whether it be a list of conjectural notes, the reproduction of primary sources, and explications of
                  the provenance and history of a particular play. The act of appropriately displaying these disparate
                  forms of content is an ongoing effort.

              <h2>Future Tools</h2>
              <p>
                  Envisioned by the design team for the digital edition of the NVS is a suite of research tools
                  including an advanced search across multiple editions; visualizations of search results (such as a
                  character-based frequency plot which will convey what characters most frequently use search terms in
                  their speeches); the ability to sort and filter play lines, textual notes, and commentary in tabular
                  format; and the ability to download raw versions of the data as JSON or TEI. We also hope to integrate
                  external sources of information about a given play line or bibliographic entry.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Also forthcoming are tools for building future digital editions of the NVS. Aside from providing
                  web-based tools for creating appropriately marked-up commentary notes and paratexts, plans include
                  affordances for collated editions to be OCR’d, hand corrected, and lineated. This will allow for
                  collations to occur automatically, saving decades of time compared to the conventional methods of
                  collating a variorum.
