        <p>The first New Variorum edition of The Winter&#x27;s Tale, the work of Horace Howard
          Furness, appeared in 1898. The present edition retraces Furness&#x27;s but does not
          replace it, for often the more recent scholarship and criticism reported here could be accommodated only
          by reducing Furness&#x27;s ampler treatment of the early material. The reader who finds
          this book useful is urged to consult Furness&#x27;s as well to obtain a fuller account
          of many subjects.</p>
        <p>Patricia Tatspaugh wrote the section of this edition on performances and Andrew Sabol that on music.
          Robert Jones handled criticism in German. Although Virginia Haas worked primarily on the sections on
          criticism and the text on the stage, she had a hand throughout. Except for specific contributions
          acknowledged in their place, Robert Turner did the rest. Much of the work was done at the University of
          Wisconsin–Milwaukee, having been underwritten by its College of Letters and Science (William F.
          Halloran, dean, and Jessica R. Wirth, associate dean). The Research Committee of the university&#x27;
          s Graduate School provided generous support, as did its Golda Meir Library (William F. Roselle
          and Peter Watson-Boone, library directors), which created and fostered a Shakespeare collection rivaled
          by few universities in the United States and by hardly any recently established ones. The Memorial
          Library of the University of Wisconsin–Madison (Kenneth L. Frazier, director of libraries) maintains a
          similarly distinguished collection for the use of the general editors of the Variorum series. The
          support of both libraries has been invaluable.</p>
        <p>Financial aid for this edition was provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Folger
          Shakespeare Library, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the American Philosophical Society,
          the American Council of Learned Societies, the Newberry Library Renaissance Consortium, and the Modern
          Language Association of America (Phyllis Franklin, executive director). Libraries at which research was
          done include the Folger Shakespeare Library; the Furness Memorial Library of the University of
          Pennsylvania; the New York Public Library; the British Library; the Bodleian Library; the Cambridge
          University Library; the Libraries of the Shakespeare Centre, Trinity College and Pembroke College,
          Cambridge; the University of London; the Research Services Department of the Theatre Museum (Victoria
          and Albert Museum); the Library of the Garrick Club; and the Hampden Booth Theatre Library. Their
          hospitality is greatly appreciated. The Beinecke Library, Yale University Library, and the Henry E.
          Huntington Library supplied information, and among the individuals who helped in various ways are Walter
          S. Achtert, Stephen Booth, Fredson Bowers, Gerry Flynn, Philip Gaskell, Joseph Gibaldi, Charlton Hinman,
          Cyrus Hoy, Taro Kusanagi, James G. McManaway, Barbara A. Mowat, Marvin Spevack, Judith Cook Svenheim,
          Roy Swanson, John Velz, George Walton Williams, and George T. Wright. I especially want to thank
          Patricia Rieselbach and James P. Hammersmith for their excellent assistance. Richard Knowles, the
          general editor of the New Variorum Shakespeare, made innumerable improvements, caught many mistakes,
          contributed his own critical ideas and evaluations, and in general shaped this edition much for the
          better. More recently, Paul Werstine, his fellow general editor, began to do the same. Virginia Haas and
          I are grateful to them both. We are also obliged to Susan Joseph, our copy editor, whose sharp eye saved
          us from error and sharp mind gave rise to a number of changes for the better.</p>

        <h2 class="anchor" id="the-winters-tale-plan-of-work"><em>The Winter&#x27;s Tale</em> Plan of Work</h2>
        <p>This edition of The Winter&#x27;s Tale has four main parts: a text of the play
          reprinted with little change from that of the first edition in Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies,
          Histories, &amp; Tragedies, the Folio of 1623 (F1); textual notes of significant
          departures from the F1 text in eighty-six editions of the play ranging in date from 1632 to 1988;
          commentary on the meaning or the artistry of the text drawn from editions, dictionaries, and critical
          works; and a collection of more general textual, historical, critical, and theatrical information about
          the play.</p>
        <p>The text presented here derives from photocopies of one of the copies of F1 in the Folger Shakespeare
          Library. The transcript of these prints was compared with the WT texts of several other Folger copies,
          Sidney Lee&#x27;s Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies
          being a Reproduction in Facsimile of the First Folio Edition (Oxford, 1902), and Charlton Hinman&#x27;
          s The Norton Facsimile: The First Folio of Shakespeare (New York, 1968), the object being to
          make the Variorum text as accurate as possible. No F1 press variants affecting WT readings have as yet
          been found (see here). Silent alterations of the F1 text include the representation of roman long s by
          s; the printing of logotypes (at lines 1672 and 2146) and ligatures (e.g., roman ss and st) as two
          letters; the suppression or reduction of framing rules, display types, ornaments, printing space types,
          quads, and packing; the alignment of irregular letters and normalization of spacing (except in some
          instances noted below); the positioning of marginal stage directions to the right regardless of their
          placement in the F1 line; and the correction of wrong-font types, including alteration of italic
          punctuation marks to roman in a roman context and vice versa. Other errors are corrected when there is
          no doubt what the true reading should be. In a few instances missing punctuation is supplied, words
          turned up or down by F1 because the full line of text exceeded the measure of the column are printed in
          one line, and conventional closing punctuation is substituted for other marks at the end of completed
          speeches where no suspension seems intended. A list of these changes appears in the Appendix (see here).
          Also listed there are spellings probably adopted by F1 for justification. The line numbers of the text
          are the Through Line Numbers introduced by Charlton Hinman in The Norton Facsimile: The First Folio of
          Shakespeare (New York, 1968), but the headlines include, as well, the act-scene-line numbers of the 1974
          Riverside WT, edited by G. Blakemore Evans. Riverside act and scene divisions are indicated by boldface
          numerals in the right margin. Also in the right margins, signature and column indicators of the
          beginning of each Folio column appear in parentheses.</p>
        <p>Please note that clicking on a word or line in the play text calls up the corresponding note in the
          commentary column, and vice versa. (KT will add more text here once site is complete)</p>
        <p>The textual notes, which are visualized as a histogram in the left panel of the Variorum Reader, record
          alterations in the meaning or meter of the F1 text found in the editions collated; alteration of meaning
          was decided by the variant&#x27;s receiving separate listing in the Oxford English
          Dictionary and a different definition. Modernizations of form are ignored. So are misprints unless the
          misprint creates an English word or was taken for a word. Conjectural emendations are included in the
          textual notes if the reading has been adopted by one of the editions collated; others are in the list of
          unadopted conjectures (here). Alterations in punctuation and capitalization are ignored unless the
          alteration creates a different meaning. Stage directions added or altered in later editions appear only
          if the action implied by F1 is affected in a major way. Variant lining affecting meter—verse as prose,
          prose as verse, verse as different verse—is noted. The elision or expansion of syllables is recorded
          only if the alteration shifts the word&#x27;s accent or alters the number of feet in a
          verse line. When words that may be elided must be elided to make regular verse (e.g., in the to
          one-syllable i&#x27;th) it is assumed that elision was intended and no note is provided.
          Added stage directions calling for action clearly implied by the text are not recorded, nor are those
          calling in different words for essentially the same action as the stage direction of the text.</p>
        <p>The way textual notes appear on this website is...(KT will add content here about navigating textual
          notes on this site. This explanation will be similar to the instructions for textual notes on the
          &quot;How to Digital NVS page).</p>
        <p>Beneath the textual notes is commentary on specific words or passages in the text. The glosses and
          explanatory notes of many editions of WT are quoted there, and definitions are drawn from works of
          reference and dictionaries, especially the Oxford English Dictionary but also dictionaries nearer
          Shakespeare&#x27;s time such as John Minsheu&#x27;s Ductor in Linguas,
          The Guide into Tongues (1617) and Henry Cockeram&#x27;s English Dictionarie (1623), as
          well as Samuel Johnson&#x27;s Dictionary of the English Language (1755). Foreign
          language dictionaries—John Florio&#x27;s English-Italian Queen Anna&#x27;
          s New World of Words (1611), for example—are sometimes used, as are specialized glossaries such
          as Henry Manwayring&#x27;s Sea-mans Dictionary (1644), B. E.&#x27;s
          Dictionary of the Terms . . . of the Canting Crew (1699), and Edward Sugden&#x27;s
          Topographical Dictionary (1925). Alexander Schmidt&#x27;s Shakespeare-Lexicon and C. T.
          Onions&#x27;s Shakespeare Glossary are the sources of many definitions, and E. A. Abbott
          &#x27;s Shakespearian Grammar and Wilhelm Franz&#x27;s Die Sprache
          Shakespeares are frequently alluded to. In general, the first comment to be made is quoted, but if a
          later one is clearer, more accurate, or more explicit, it appears instead. In these notes and elsewhere
          square brackets within quotations enclose corrections or comments made by the editors of this volume;
          the square brackets of the quotations themselves have been transformed to angle brackets (\&lt;
          \&gt;). The spelling and punctuation of the works cited are retained except
          that if the beginning or the end of a sentence has been omitted but a complete sentence remains, it is
          provided with a beginning capital or a final period. Initial capitals are also supplied for direct
          discourse. No notes are printed entirely in italics even though the source may have done so.</p>
        <p>Commentary notes can be found in the Variorum Reader&#x27;s far right panel and...(KT
          will add content here about navigating commentary notes on this site. This explanation will be similar
          to the instructions on the &quot;How to Digital NVS&quot; page).</p>
        <p>This edition also includes an Appendix which begins with a list of the F1 readings emended in the
          present text. Following that is another collection, a listing of proposed substantive emendations never
          adopted in the editions of WT collated. The subsequent sections are more general. Included are an essay
          on the text of the play—its authenticity, the printing of the F1 version, the scribal copy from which
          the compositors worked, and the copy from which the scribe worked and his fidelity to it. A second essay
          considers the date of the play&#x27;s composition; a third examines the play&#x27;
          s sources, primarily Robert Greene&#x27;s Pandosto but also minor sources and
          analogues. Imitations are also mentioned. Following is a selection of the literary criticism of the play
          and then a stage history that includes a record of how the text has been altered for the theater, an
          account of important performances, and a discussion of the actors who have taken major roles, as well as
          of directors responsible for significant interpretations. Finally, there is an account of the songs and
          dances that embellish the play&#x27;s dialogue and action.</p>
