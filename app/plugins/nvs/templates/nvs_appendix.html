            the hard boate thy cradle? Shall thy tender mouth in steede of sweete kisses, be nipped with bitter stormes?
            Shalt thou haue [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1496–7</span></span>] the whistling winds

            being suppressed with sorrow, she fell downe in a traunce, hauing her sences so sotted with care, that after

            and
            conspired with Franion to poyson Pandosto her husband, but [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1191–5</span></span>]
            their pretence being partely spyed,
            shee counselled them to flie away by night for their better safety. Bellaria, who standing like a prisoner
            at

            then

            mercy shee neyther craued nor hoped for, and that those periured wretches, which had falsly accused her to
            the

            Pandosto, whose rage and Iealousie was
            such, as no reason, nor equitie could appease: tolde her, that for her accusers they were of such credite,
            as
            their wordes were sufficient witnesse, and that the sodaine and secret flight of Egistus, and Franion
            confirmed that which they had confessed: and as for her, it was her parte to deny such a monstrus crime, and
            to be impudent in forswearing the [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1263</span></span>] fact,
            since [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1229–32</span></span>] shee had past all shame in

            she bare was
            serued, so she should with some cruell death be requited. Bellaria no whit dismayed with this rough reply,
            [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1196–1228</span></span>] tolde her Husband Pandosto, that he

            for any lusting affection:
            therefore if she were condemned without any further proofe, [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1293</span></span>]
            it was rigour, and not Law. The noble
            men which sate in iudgement, said that Bellaria spake reason, and intreated the king that the accusers might
            be openly examined, and sworne, and if then the euidence were such, as the Iury might finde her guilty (for
            seeing she was a Prince,<sup class="in-text">14</sup> she ought to be tryed by her peeres)<sup
                class="in-text">15</sup> then let her haue such punishment as the

            might, and would dispence with the Law, and that the Iury being once panneld, they should take his word for
            sufficient euidence, otherwise he would make the proudest of them repent it. The noble men seeing the king

            good wealth, who had a well
            lined purse . . . which a crue of foists [pickpockets] hauing perceiued, their hearts were set on fire to
            haue
            it, & euery one had a fling at him, but all in vaine, for he kept his hand close in his pocket, and his
            purse
            fast in his fist. . . . At last one of the crue . . . walkt directly before him and next him three or foure
            turnes, at last standing still, he cried alas honest man helpe me, I am not well, & with that sunck downe
            suddenly in a sown, the pore Farmer seeing a proper yong Gentleman (as hee thought) fall dead afore him,
            stept
            to him, helde him in his armes, rubd him & chaft him: at this there gathered a great multitude of people
            about
            him, and the whilest the Foiste drewe the farmers purse and away: by that the other thought the feat was
            done,
            he began to come something to himselfe againe, and so halfe staggering, stumbled out of Paules, and went
            after
            the crue where they had appointed to meet, and their boasted of his wit and experience.</p>

          <p class="x-large-margin">... Com to Gracious street, wher this villanous pranke was performed. A roging mate,
            & such another with
            him, were there got vpon a stal singing of balets which belike was som prety toy, for very many gathered
            about
            to heare it, & diuers buying, as their affections serued, drew to their purses & paid the singers for them.
            The slye mate and his fellowes, who were dispersed among them that stoode to heare the songes: well noted
            where euerie man that bought, put vp his purse againe, and to such as would not buy, counterfeit warning was
            sundrie times giuen by the rogue and his associate, to beware of the cut pursse, and looke to their pursses,
            which made them often feel where their pursses were, either in sleeue, hose, or at girdle, to know whether
            they were safe or no. Thus the craftie copesmates were acquainted with what they most desired, and as they
            were scattered, by shouldering, thrusting, feigning to let fall something, and other wilie tricks fit for
            their purpose: heere one lost his purse, there another had his pocket pickt, and to say all in briefe, at
            one
            instant, vpon the complaint of one or two that sawe their pursses were gone, eight more in the same
            companie,
            found themselues in like predicament.</p>

          <p class="medium large-margin left-align"><b>That Sh. was not the author of the entirety of</b> WT was casually suggested
            by <span
                class="blue-link">Pope</span> (ed. 1725, 1:xx): I make
            no
            doubt to declare that those wretched plays [such as Pericles, added to the canon in <span
                class="orange-link">F3</span>], cannot be
            admitted as
            his. And I should conjecture of some of the others, (particularly Love’s Labour Lost, The Winter’s Tale,
            and
            Titus Andronicus) that only some characters, single scenes, or perhaps a few particular passages, were of
            his
            hand. <span class="blue-link">Robertson</span> (1930, pp. 133–4), a more dedicated disintegrator, also finds
            WT unworthy. Time’s prologue
            (lines <span class="tln">TLN <span class="tln-digits">1579–1611</span></span>) “has quite an
            un-Shakespearean aspect. The I mentioned [1601], further, implies a
            previous prologue, which has been dropped. Perhaps the clearest ground for suspecting a non-Shakespearean
            hand
            is the rhyming of after with daughter, a thing unexampled in Shakespeare’s serious work, but emphatically
            of a
            kind of perverse rhyming much affected by Chapman.” (For the rhyme, see n. 1606–7.) The chief æsthetic
            difficulty of the play, Leontes’s sudden jealousy, is not like [134] Shakespeare. . . . It would be a more
            satisfying solution if . . . the unnaturally rapid action had been imposed by a previous constructor, of
            whom we seem to find plain traces.</p>

          <p class="indent x-large-margin left-align">The critical problems <b><span class="blue-link">Robertson</span> discovers
            have concerned
            others (see n. <span class="tln-digits">181–92</span> for Leontes’s jealousy, for
            example), but no one else attributes the apparent disparities to a previous constructor. WT is generally
            regarded as authentically Sh.’s. Some critics who accept this opinion believe, nevertheless, that the play
            as
            it stands is a revision of a version in which Hermione really dies. See, for example, Craig (</b><em>Revisions</em>,
            <span class="old-style-numbers">1931, pp. 347–8</span>) and, for a more recent expression of the idea, <span

          <p class="left-align medium">These instances are too sparse to impair Honigmann’s argument. Hence, <span class="blue-link">Bullough</span> (1975, 8:130): Sh. may have
          been encouraged by The Fisherman’s Tale to develop its vignettes of rustic life, for Cassander disguises
            himself as a real English shepherd, buys sheepe and cotes <span class="small"><b>[C4<sup>v</sup>]</b></span>, and sets up as a newcomer to the district
          before wooing the maiden. Later he disguises himself as a crippled beggar to visit Flora’s house, and
          receives
            alms. Obviously Cassander enjoys his deceit. Is this the germ of Autolycus?</p>
          <p class="left-align medium">This story was told to Florisel and Silvie, who stole into the palace grounds and managed to see the
          images:
          contemplerent longuement les cors & les têtes d’icelles ymages, qui se montroyent aussi vermeilles comme
          si
          elles eussent été coupees tout fraichement [for a long time they contemplated the bodies and the heads of
          those images, which appeared as ruddy as if they had just been cut off; cf. WT 3240–1]. When Manatiles
          later
          visited the images, Florisel and Silvie heard him soliloquise: O Dieu souverain, ou auoise-ie l’esprit,
          quand
          ie permis que telle cruauté fût executee en mon propre enfant. . . . Ah amour, que tu es cause de grandes
          malheurtés & infortunes, ne m’étoit-ce point assés d’auoir m’êchamment meudry ma femme tant preude &
          chaste,
          sans me souiller, [32] & contaminer mes mains de mon sang propre, priuant moy & ce tant riche Royaume de
          legitime heritier? [O sovereign Lord, where was my mind when I permitted such cruelty to be visited upon
          my
          own child. . . . Ah love, who are the cause of great unhappiness and adversity, was it not enough to have
          wickedly murdered my wife so modest and chaste, without staining myself and dirtying my hands with my own
          blood, depriving myself and this very rich realm of a legitimate heir? Cf. WT 2733–9 ff.] Manatiles
          decided,
          however, that repentance was foolish, and thought that the execution of the two lovers was an act of
            justice.</p>
