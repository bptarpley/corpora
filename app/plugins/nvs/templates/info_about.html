          <p>The New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare (NVS), which began collating previous editions of <em>Romeo and
            Juliet</em> in
            1871, is now published open-access in digital form, beginning with two editions in 2021, and then extending
            forward (new editors are under contract) and backward to eventually include all the volumes in the series.
            The
            digital edition has been designed with three main goals: 1) to teach students and early career researchers
            the
            concepts behind variorum editing through interface design as well as tutorials; 2) to enable searching
            across
            and within volumes and variants using Modern English and major Act-Scene-Line numbers, returning not only
            exportable lists, text, and bibliographical citations, but also visualizations demonstrating everything from
            when characters speak in plays to the evolution of variant histories; and 3) to be interoperable with, and
            allow access to, other major Shakespeare digital resources including bibliographies of criticism, digital
            copies of editions published since Shakespeare’s time, images, and videos. Following the practice of
            state-of-the-art digital humanities projects, we aim to render Shakespeare’s texts and international
            criticism
            available world-wide.

          <h2>NVS History</h2>
          <p>The New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare (NVS) was founded in Philadelphia in 1871 by the American lawyer
            Horace Howard Furness, with an edition of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. The term variorum alludes to the Latin
            phrase
            <em>editio cum notis variorum</em>, that is, “an edition with the notes of the various [editors and
            commentators],” a
            phrase indicating the chief purpose of a variorum edition: namely, to collect what has been written by
            various
            commentators, critics, and editors. Furness called his edition "New" because there had already been seven
            earlier variorum editions of Shakespeare, the earliest in 1773, and the latest, before his own, in 1821. By
            the time he died in 1912, Furness had edited fifteen plays in variorum format, including the major
            tragedies,
            <em>Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear, Othello,</em> and <em>Anthony and Cleopatra</em>.
          </p>
          <p>Long before his death, his son had joined him in the work. Horace Howard Furness Jr. edited four plays and
            was working on <em>Henry V</em> when death took him in 1930. Before his death, Furness Jr. had consulted the
            University
            of Pennsylvania’s Professor Felix E. Schelling, seeking from among the university’s junior faculty two
            assistants. Schelling directed him to Matthias Shaaber and Matthew W. Black, who completed <em>Henry IV,
              Part
              II,</em>
            in 1940, and <em>Richard II</em> in 1955 respectively. Thus the series began to be the work of professional
            academics.
            Shaaber continued to work on the series and supplied the commentary notes to Richard Knowles's edition of
            <em>As
              You Like It</em> (1977).
          </p>
          <p>In 1933 the NVS became an official project of the Modern Languages Association of America (MLA), under the
            specific direction of an advisory committee and a general editor. The first general editor was Joseph Quincy
            Adams, first director of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC, who was followed by Hyder E.
            Rollins
            and then by James G. McManaway. Neither Adams nor McManaway produced a variorum himself, but Rollins
            completed
            editions of both the <em>Poems</em> (1938) and the <em>Sonnets</em> (1944). Besides attending to Shaaber and
            Black’s editions,
            these early general editors oversaw editions of <em>Henry IV, Part 1,</em> by Samuel B. Hemingway (1936),
            and an
            edition of <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> (1953), by Harold N. Hillebrand and T. W. Baldwin.
          </p>
          <p>After a hiatus following 1955, the NVS surged forward between 1977 and 1990 under the general editorship of
            Robert K. Turner Jr., soon joined in that role by Richard Knowles, with publication of three editions, <em>As
              You
              Like It, Mark Eccles' Measure for Measure</em> (1980), and Marvin Spevack's <em>Antony and Cleopatra</em>
            (1990).
          </p>
          <p>In 1997, Turner stepped down as a general editor in order to finish the edition of <em>The Winter's
            Tale</em>
            with
            Virginia Westling Haas, published in 2005 as both a book and an electronic edition on CD-ROM, and Paul
            Werstine joined Knowles as a general editor. In 2011 Standish Henning's edition of <em>The Comedy of
              Errors</em>
            was
            also published as a book and a CD-ROM. In 2020 Knowles's edition of <em>King Lear</em> appeared in two
            volumes
            as the
            last NVS edition to be published by MLA. In 2015, while <em>Lear</em> was at press, Eric Rasmussen joined
            Knowles and
            Werstine as a general editor of the series.
          </p>
          <p>In 2017, MLA's Executive Council established a Working Group consisting of Matt Cohen, Julia Flanders, Alan
            Galey, and Valerie Wayne to find a new publisher for the NVS. The Working Group chose as its Chair Lena
            Orlin.
            In 2019 Laura Mandell, Director of the Center of Digital Humanities Research (CoDHR) at Texas A&M
            University,
            generously offered to publish the NVS and contracted with Anne Burdick to build a site for the series in
            order
            to bring it to the WWW and thereby to a broad audience.
