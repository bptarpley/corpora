            the hard boate thy cradle? Shall thy tender mouth in steede of sweete kisses, be nipped with bitter stormes?
            Shalt thou haue [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1496–7</span></span>] the whistling winds

            being suppressed with sorrow, she fell downe in a traunce, hauing her sences so sotted with care, that after
            she was reuiued, yet she lost her memorie, and lay for a great time without mouing as one in a traunce. The

            and
            conspired with Franion to poyson Pandosto her husband, but [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1191–5</span></span>]
            their pretence being partely spyed,
            shee counselled them to flie away by night for their better safety. Bellaria, who standing like a prisoner
            at

            then
            death could pacifie her husbands wrath, waxed bolde, and desired that she might haue Lawe and Iustice, for
            mercy shee neyther craued nor hoped for, and that those periured wretches, which had falsly accused her to
            the

            Pandosto, whose rage and Iealousie was
            such, as no reason, nor equitie could appease: tolde her, that for her accusers they were of such credite,
            as
            their wordes were sufficient witnesse, and that the sodaine and secret flight of Egistus, and Franion
            confirmed that which they had confessed: and as for her, it was her parte to deny such a monstrus crime, and
            to be impudent in forswearing the [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1263</span></span>] fact,
            since [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1229–32</span></span>] shee had past all shame in

            she bare was
            serued, so she should with some cruell death be requited. Bellaria no whit dismayed with this rough reply,
            [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1196–1228</span></span>] tolde her Husband Pandosto, that he

            for any lusting affection:
            therefore if she were condemned without any further proofe, [<span class="tln">tln <span class="tln-digits">1293</span></span>]
            it was rigour, and not Law. The noble
            men which sate in iudgement, said that Bellaria spake reason, and intreated the king that the accusers might
            be openly examined, and sworne, and if then the euidence were such, as the Iury might finde her guilty (for
            seeing she was a Prince,<sup class="in-text">14</sup> she ought to be tryed by her peeres)<sup
                class="in-text">15</sup> then let her haue such punishment as the

            might, and would dispence with the Law, and that the Iury being once panneld, they should take his word for
            sufficient euidence, otherwise he would make the proudest of them repent it. The noble men seeing the king

            where euerie man that bought, put vp his purse againe, and to such as would not buy, counterfeit warning was
            sundrie times giuen by the rogue and his associate, to beware of the cut pursse, and looke to their pursses,
            which made them often feel where their pursses were, either in sleeue, hose, or at girdle, to know whether
            they were safe or no. Thus the craftie copesmates were acquainted with what they most desired, and as they
            were scattered, by shouldering, thrusting, feigning to let fall something, and other wilie tricks fit for
            their purpose: heere one lost his purse, there another had his pocket pickt, and to say all in briefe, at
            one
            instant, vpon the complaint of one or two that sawe their pursses were gone, eight more in the same
            companie,

            Titus Andronicus) that only some characters, single scenes, or perhaps a few particular passages, were of

            hand
            is the rhyming of after with daughter, a thing unexampled in Shakespeare’s serious work, but emphatically
            of a
            kind of perverse rhyming much affected by Chapman.” (For the rhyme, see n. 1606–7.) The chief æsthetic
            difficulty of the play, Leontes’s sudden jealousy, is not like [134] Shakespeare. . . . It would be a more
            satisfying solution if . . . the unnaturally rapid action had been imposed by a previous constructor, of
            whom we seem to find plain traces.</p>

            and sets up as a newcomer to the district

            receives
            alms. Obviously Cassander enjoys his deceit. Is this the germ of Autolycus?</p>
          <p class="left-align medium">This story was told to Florisel and Silvie, who stole into the palace grounds and
            managed to see the
            images:
            contemplerent longuement les cors & les têtes d’icelles ymages, qui se montroyent aussi vermeilles comme
            si
            elles eussent été coupees tout fraichement [for a long time they contemplated the bodies and the heads of
            those images, which appeared as ruddy as if they had just been cut off; cf. WT 3240–1]. When Manatiles
            later
            visited the images, Florisel and Silvie heard him soliloquise: O Dieu souverain, ou auoise-ie l’esprit,
            quand
            ie permis que telle cruauté fût executee en mon propre enfant. . . . Ah amour, que tu es cause de grandes
            malheurtés & infortunes, ne m’étoit-ce point assés d’auoir m’êchamment meudry ma femme tant preude &
            chaste,
            sans me souiller, [32] & contaminer mes mains de mon sang propre, priuant moy & ce tant riche Royaume de
            legitime heritier? [O sovereign Lord, where was my mind when I permitted such cruelty to be visited upon
            my
            own child. . . . Ah love, who are the cause of great unhappiness and adversity, was it not enough to have
            wickedly murdered my wife so modest and chaste, without staining myself and dirtying my hands with my own
            blood, depriving myself and this very rich realm of a legitimate heir? Cf. WT 2733–9 ff.] Manatiles
            decided,
            however, that repentance was foolish, and thought that the execution of the two lovers was an act of
            justice.</p>
